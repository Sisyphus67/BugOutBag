In a crisis situation the decision to flee or hunkerdown in place is one of the first decisions to make and, if the decision is to hunker down, it must be revisited periodically.

The variables to consider when making this decision vary by individual, but I will try to outline mine.  The most important thing to remember is to plan ahead and to perform thought experiments as to the correct decision making process.  The fight or flight response is a misnomer, because there is also a freeze response (think of a deer in the headlights).
